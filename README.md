# Project Name

## Description

This project is a [Go](https://golang.org/) implementation of a memcached server.

## Features

- Lightweight and efficient
- Support for key-value storage
- High performance caching
- Simple and easy to use API

## Installation

To install and run the memcached server, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/go-memcached.git`
2. Change into the project directory: `cd go-memcached`
3. Build the project: `go build`
4. Run the server: `./go-memcached`

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with it using a memcached client library or the [telnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet) command.

Here's an example of how to set a key-value pair using telnet:

```
$ telnet localhost 11211
set mykey 0 3600 5
value
STORED
```

To retrieve the value:

```
$ telnet localhost 11211
get mykey
VALUE mykey 0 5
value
END
```

For more information on the available commands, refer to the [memcached protocol documentation](https://github.com/memcached/memcached/blob/master/doc/protocol.txt).
